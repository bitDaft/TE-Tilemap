# TE Tilemap

  - This library will be used for loading and using tilemaps in Project-TE
  - Currently it will only have support for animated tiles, layers and multiple textures.
  - later on as need arises we will other functionality into as also built into Tiled.
  - This will only store and manage the data needed for the tilemap
  - The actual usage of the data will be on Project-TE
  - This library could also be used to make an application to create tilemaps in GUI and then later export that file for usage in the game engine
